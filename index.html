            <p class="p">Hello myself Sagar poudel. Iâ€™m from Nepal. I would like to share my some of the leadership skills from me towards my schools and community. Firstly I would like to talk about confidence which is the most quality. As I can proudly says that I have a good academic background for my mathematics subject which seems to be very difficult subject for most of the students. In my high school, to be honest with you I have actively participating on tutoring students of lower secondary level for mathematics subject.</p>
